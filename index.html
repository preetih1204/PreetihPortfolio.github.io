        <p>Hi There! My name is Preeti Hargunani. I'm a Computer Engineer by qualification and have experience in teaching Computer Science 
           to students from Elementary to Undergrad. I have also worked as a Software Professional at some of the renowned tech companies.
         </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Professor and Head of Department, Mumbai University, India</h2>
        
        <p> Teaching has always been my passion!<br/>
        I started my career as a Professor for Computer Engineering at Mumbai University in India and taught various courses during my six 
        year tenure there.<br/>
        In addition to teaching, I also served as the Head of Department for Information Technology at the college.
        </p>

  <br>

        <p><h2>Software Engineer</h2></p>
        <p> After I came to the US in 2014, I decided to gain some industry experience.<br/>
          I worked as a Software Engineer at the Bank of America and as a Program Manager at Microsoft Azure.
</p>
         <br>
        <p><h2>Computer Programming Teacher for Elementary to High School</h2></p>
        <p>I volunteered for the Microsoft TEALS program where I taught coding to Mid through High school Students for 5+ years.<br/>
          Most recently I'm teaching coding to Elementary through High school students on the online platforms Coding With Kids and Outschool.com.
