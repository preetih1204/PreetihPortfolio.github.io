	<p>Hi There! My name is Preeti Hargunani. I'm a Computer Engineer by qualification and have experience in teaching Computer Science 
	    at renowned university and working as a software professional at some of the best companies.
	   </p>
	  <p><h2>Professor and Head of Department</h2></p>
	  <p> Teaching has always been my passion!<br/>
	  I started my career as a Professor for Computer Engineering at Mumbai University in India and taught various courses during my six 
	  year tenure there.<br/>
	  In addition to teaching, I also served as the Head of Department for Information Technology during my last year at the college.</p>
	  
	  <p><h2>Software Engineer</h2></p>
	  <p> After I came to the US in 2014, I decided to gain some industry experience.<br/>
		  I worked as a Software Engineer at the Bank of America and most recently worked as a Program Manager at Microsoft Azure.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p><h2>Volunteer Teacher</h2></p>
	  <p> Eventhough, I decided to gain industry experience my passion for teaching has always been strong. <br/>
		  To pursue my passion, I joined Microsoft TEALS in 2015 as a volunteer Teacher/TA for teaching Computer Science to school students and have
		  since been an active volunteer with them.
